What is next
=============

Date created: 2025-10-03

This file will track planned work and progress. I'll update it whenever I make edits or when you tell me you've completed items.

Planned items (user's list)
- Add ARSII events as a member of the association (photos + descriptions).
- Add photos of awards/wins and event highlights.
- Add demo videos for the two featured projects; clicking a project card should open the demo (modal or redirect).
- Review and add or change additional content after demos and imagery are in place.

Suggested implementation steps (small, actionable)
1. Create an `assets/images/` folder and place event and award photos there.
2. Add a lightbox/modal component and wire clicking on a project card to open the relevant demo video.
3. Optimize images (resize, convert to WebP) and lazy-load them.
4. Add captions and accessible alt text for all images.
5. Add a "Media" or "Gallery" section if you want a place to display multiple photos.
6. Update `CODE_NOTES.txt` and this file with each change (date + description).

Current status
- File created and initial plan recorded.

Next steps for me (if you want me to continue)
- I can add a modal video player and wire the two project cards to open the demo videos (I will need the video files or links).
- I can create an `assets/images` directory and add placeholders for the photos and update the HTML.

Tell me which of these you'd like me to implement first. If you want to add files yourself, tell me their paths and names and I'll reference them in the site and update the checklist.
